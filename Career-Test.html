  <h3>This is the Career Test result I received from 123test.com.</h3>
  <p>
  The result of the test showed that my top career personality types are “Realistic”, “Investigative” and “Artistic”. The lowest ranking type was “Enterprising”.  I would agree with these results, as I do tend to enjoy and seek out tasks that have these attributes, and shy away from competition and leadership. However, the actual professions the web site has suggested seem quite random and unrelated.
  In a team environment I would tend to gravitate towards to the more hands on tasks, building things and creating displays etc. But also be less likely to want to take the lead on any project or be the “salesperson” in the group.
  When forming a team it is important to include people with different combinations of attributes. This balances the skills of the team so that projects can be completed more effectively. This also means that people aren’t forced to fulfill roles which they would feel uncomfortable doing.

  <h3>Career test result:</h3>
  <p>9356</p>
  <p>
  In this test you had to choose between pictures showing specific work activities. Each picture depicted work associated with a specific type of personality. These types are derived from Dr. John Holland's theory of careers and vocational choice, known as Holland Codes.
  </p>

  <p>There are six personality types in Holland's model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Realistic: practical, physical, concrete, hands-on, machine, and tool-oriented</li>
    <li>Investigative: analytical, intellectual, scientific, explorative, thinker</li>
    <li>Artistic: creative, original, independent, chaotic, inventive, media, graphics, and text</li>
    <li>Social: cooperative, supporting, helping, healing/nurturing, teaching</li>
    <li>Enterprising: competitive environments, leadership, persuading, status</li>
    <li>Conventional: detail-oriented, organizing, clerical</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Personality types and Holland Codes</h3>
  <p>
  Dr. Holland did not say that a person is just one of these types. Then there would be only six types of people in the world. Instead, any one person can have interests associated with all of the six types. When you rank the types, starting with those you have the most interest in to those you have the least interest in, you get your specific Holland Code.
  There are some 720 different combinations possible, like ISERAC, AIRSEC, or CSERIA. Generally, however, only two or three letters are necessary to create a useful description, such as SC, IRC, or AIC. Such a description may apply to both a person and a work environment. By typifying both people and work environments with Holland Codes, we can calculate matches between them. This helps you assess a potential career or vocational choice.
  </p>
  <h3>Your personality type</h3>
  <p>
  You preferred 'Realistic' the most, followed by 'Investigative' and 'Artistic'. Your six letter personality type is 'RIACSE'. Your personal preference is also shown in a graph below.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>REALISTIC 27%	</li>
      <li>INVESTIGATIVE 23%	</li>
      <li>ARTISTIC 20%	</li>
      <li>CONVENTIONAL 17%	</li>
      <li>SOCIAL 8%	</li>
      <li>ENTERPRISING 5%</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Your personal Holland Code</h3>
  <p>
  Depending on how strongly you favor any specific type you can compose your own personal Holland Code. You do this by taking the first letters of the types you favor most. In your case, this is the letters R, I and A Your personal Holland Code then becomes either RIA, RI, IR or even IRA.
  </p>
  <h3>Your jobs</h3>
  <p>
  Here is a list of jobs that fit your Holland code RIACSE. The list is only part of all jobs that fit your personality. You should use this list of occupations as prototypical examples. A total of 20 occupations are suggested based on your score.
