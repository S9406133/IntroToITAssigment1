  <h3>This is the Learn Style Test result I received from whatismylearningstyle.com.</h3>
  <p>
  The result is that I am a “Visual Learner” which I would agree with. It points out that I learn best when reading or writing information. Also, diagrams will aid my learning and I would learn best when left alone to study the material. This result is not a surprise to me. I have discovered over years of studying and even at work, that these are the best methods to employ when trying to learn new concepts.
  When working in a team, if other team members want to explain new concepts to me it would be best if they provided visual aids. Such as written slides, diagrams or charts. I would also be the one most likely to produce these types of material for the team.
  When forming a team it is best to have people with a variety of learning styles. This is an advantage in a team environment because information can be communicated in a variety of ways. If there is a person in the team who learns best with the currently communicated style, the team as a whole will receive the information more efficiently.
