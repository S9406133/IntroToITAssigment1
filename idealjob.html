  This job ad is for a Software Design Engineer at a major Australian defence and aerospace engineering company. It involves designing and developing software to implement into the products that they produce. The position would also involve post-implementation support. This job appealed to me because not only is it a software design role, it would also involve an understanding of the mechanical design of their products and the associated electronics. My current main interest in IT is the area of programming and software development. I would consider a role like this to be the pinnacle of a career in software development. Combining it with electronics, mechanical engineering and the aerospace industry makes it stand out from other jobs because they are all areas I have a keen interest in.
  This role would require a significant amount of education, including an IT degree and post graduate qualifications in engineering and possibly electronics as well. A thorough knowledge and experience with basic technical skills such as programming in C, C++ or Java, as well as excellent communication and problem-solving skills. It would also be necessary to have several years of experience working in similar roles were software project implementation processes such as CMMI or SPICE for electronics were used.
  </p>
  <p>
  Currently I have no qualifications relevant to this role. While I have studied C++ programming and electronics in the past, it was only to first year university level and I didnâ€™t achieve any actual qualification. I have not studied mechanical engineering at all (unless you count materials studies at high school). As for work experience I have spent most of my career in customer/client facing roles or managing small teams in unrelated (non-IT) jobs. I am sure that the communication and management skills I have learned from these roles are widely transferrable though.
  </p>
  <p>
  To achieve the necessary qualities required for a role such as this, my first step is to complete the Bachelor of IT course I have just begun. My focus would need to be on the software development side of IT. Once completing the degree, I would need to get a role possibly as a junior programmer and then work my way up through more challenging roles as I gain experience. While working and progressing my career I would need to complete further study in either electronic or mechanical engineering. It would also be necessary to stay well informed on the current trends and developments in software engineering, either by studying at home or formal education.
