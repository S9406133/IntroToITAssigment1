  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
  My project is to create an app for teaching beginner guitar playing. However instead of being the standard video tutorial style app that is widely available, the app I develop will include two significant features. The first being that it would have real-time sound analysis of the chords it is asking you to play and giving on-screen feed-back. The second and most significant being that it would have real-time video analysis of the chord shapes you are making with your hand on the fretboard. Again, on-screen feed-back would be provided. This feature is not available on any other online product. There would be different options available, such as only providing sound or video analysis or both at once. You would also be able to record your practice and have the analysis provided to you afterward.
  </p>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
  Guitar playing in the world is as popular as ever. Guitar sales in 2019 were up by 12% - 20%. However, the majority of new beginners are turning to online training tools to learn the basics and hone their skills. Tools such as YouTube videos and tutorial-based apps are convenient to use and good for teaching the basics but arenâ€™t able to tell you if you are employing the wrong technique which can lead to students learning incorrect finger shapes and patterns. If incorrect techniques are learned early on it can be quite difficult to undo the damage. The best option is to have a qualified teacher who can instruct you, but this can be expensive, and the lesson times may not suit your own schedule. The next best option is to have an app that you can use whenever you like that can give you accurate feed-back on your technique.
  </p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
  This app would allow users to go through a training course that would take them from absolute novice to an accomplished guitar player. It would also give them the option to start at any level they like if they are coming into it as someone who has already been playing for some time. The user would be required to sign into their account, this account would keep track of their training progress and the areas they have completed training in. When starting as a beginner the initial training would teach the user the most commonly used individual chords and then once those are mastered, they would move on to chord progressions using those chords that they have just learned. After chord progressions, basic strumming techniques would then be taught. Songs would be taught next. Users would be asked to choose from a list of songs which included the chords they have learned. They would practice those until completion. Users would also have option to select any song they like from the available catalogue however, if the song they chose included chords or playing techniques they had not previously learned, they would be instructed to start by learning the new chords or techniques individually before they moved on to practicing the actual song. Although this is the recommended learning path the user interface for this app would give users complete control over what and when they learn each technique or song. The user interface would also allow the user to control different options and settings in the app. Options such as the type of guitar being played, whether playing left or right handed will be available. They would also be able to review their lesson progress.

  <p>
  During lessons, the user will see on the screen an animation of how they should be holding their hands. Next to that the user would see a video image of themselves playing. They would have previously been required to set their camera to the correct position to capture their playing. As the lesson progresses the animation would show them the correct hand shape to make the chord and the user would copy this. Feed-back would then by given based on the position and movement of the players hand, as well as the sound of the chord played. Feed-back would be given either as audio or text on screen depending on the option the user had selected. Teaching of strumming patterns would be done in a similar way with video and animation side by side on the screen. When learning chord progressions and songs a section of the screen would show the upcoming chords to be played and the timing. The user would be able to record their lesson to review at a later time. The focus of this app is the video feed-back system and users having full control over their lessons.
  </p>
  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
  <p>
  For this app to be fully functional new software would need to be written for the actual app navigation and GUI. As well as audio recognition and video recognition software. While audio recognition software is relatively common-place and would be easily integrated into the app, video recognition software is still an emerging technology and a significant amount of development and testing would need to be put into this area. The software would be written in a programming language such as Python. The user would need to use the app on a device which has a camera, microphone and speakers.
  </p>
  <h3>Skills Required</h3>
  <p>
  A professional app or software development company would need to be engaged to create the app navigation, GUI, audio and video recognition software. Videos would need to be created to show the user the correct chord finger positions. A professional guitarist would need to be consulted so the software could be calibrated to correctly assess the guitar playing techniques being presented by the user. An audio engineer would also be consulted to give similar advice specifically about the audio recognition software. All these professionals would be relatively easy to find, although expensive. The software itself would take a significant amount of time to develop and implement.
  </p>
  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>
  If this app is successfully implemented beginner guitar players will have an excellent alternative learning platform. It would be the only app available that includes finger technique feedback so people would move away from other apps to use this one. They will be able to practice at a time of their choosing and receive accurate and timely feed-back about their playing style without the high cost of and inconvenience of an actual guitar tutor. While people will still use YouTube because it is free and guitar tutors because of the interpersonal teaching method, this app would be the best option for those wanting an online tool that has the benefits of an actual tutor.
